#Palette management

We have to share palettes and keep track of them lest the code become an unusable mess full of redundant code, so here is our palette structure as of now:

PAL0: Background palette, 0th color must be black

PAL1: Frisk palette, this palette shouldn't need to be changed much, it contains all colors needed to draw frisk, the heart, the fonts, toriel, and flowey.

PAL2 and PAL3: Discretionary, can be used for extra tile colors needed for a background or a swap palette for sprites chaning colors.
